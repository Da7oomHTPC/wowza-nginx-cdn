yum -y install dstat - to monitor disk performance

nodetool getcompactionthroughput - default is 16MB/sec - needs to be increased!
nodetool describecluster - check if Schema versions are the same!
nodetool status
nodetool tablehistograms - see maximum response time!!!
nodetool compactionstats - see number of pending tasks!!!
nodetool netstats - monitor joining process
nodetool cfstats - show table statistics and read/write latency
nodetool proxyhistograms - read/write latency statistics including network latency - useful to see if requests encounter a slow node
nodetool cfhistograms keyspace table - if there is huge delta between 99% and Max (say 20 times or more) you must change your compaction strategy.
nodetool tpstats - show status of active tasks

for node replacement - at the end of cassandra-env.sh:
JVM_OPTS="$JVM_OPTS -Dcassandra.replace_address=10.20.10.2"
don't forget to remove it after booting!!!

du -h -t10k -d3 /mnt/cassandra/data/dvr/|sort -rh - get a list of tabes and their size.

if compaction causes issues:
nodetool setcompactionthroughput 16 - throttle compaction
nodetool stop compaction - stop and disable compaction
nodetool disablebinary && nodetool disablegossip && nodetool disablethrift && nodetool setcompactionthroughput 0 - take the node out (and unthrottle)
